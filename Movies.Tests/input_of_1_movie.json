    "body": "Billy Crystal plays put-out-to-graze baseball commentator Artie who reluctantly pitches up with his indulgent wife Diane (Midler) at the home of their daughter Alice (Tomei).\nThey've been cajoled into looking after their grand-kids - brainy 12-year-old Harper (Madison), stuttering wall-flower Turner (Rush) and the youngest, pocket rebel Barker (Breitkopf).\nWhile Alice and her gizmo-obsessed husband Artie (Everett Scott) head off for a few days at a resort, it's up to Artie and Diane - who hardly know their grandchildren - to hold the fort and nurture the nippers.\nA few bright lines crop up in this tired slave to formula but it's a largely dull affair relying on two stars who were once very much of the moment - from Throw Momma From The Train (Crystal) to Beaches (Midler) - but now seem to have lost their spark.\nThere's the expected pratfalls - Barker tinkling on skateboard legend Tony Hawke, a half-hearted food fight and a family bonding session during a game of kick-the-can in a rainstorm but in an era of Modern Family excellence it's pretty thin gruel.\nThings reach a low when Artie vomits in a child's face.\nFace it Billy, this isn't that funny.",

It doesn't help that he and his wife Diane (Bette Midler) have no truck with 21st century parenting methods and haven't got a clue how to operate their daughter's hi-tech house's gadgets. Chaos ensues... but life lessons are learned in this raucous family comedy.",
