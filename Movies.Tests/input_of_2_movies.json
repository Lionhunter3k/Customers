    "body": "Billy Crystal plays put-out-to-graze baseball commentator Artie who reluctantly pitches up with his indulgent wife Diane (Midler) at the home of their daughter Alice (Tomei).\nThey've been cajoled into looking after their grand-kids - brainy 12-year-old Harper (Madison), stuttering wall-flower Turner (Rush) and the youngest, pocket rebel Barker (Breitkopf).\nWhile Alice and her gizmo-obsessed husband Artie (Everett Scott) head off for a few days at a resort, it's up to Artie and Diane - who hardly know their grandchildren - to hold the fort and nurture the nippers.\nA few bright lines crop up in this tired slave to formula but it's a largely dull affair relying on two stars who were once very much of the moment - from Throw Momma From The Train (Crystal) to Beaches (Midler) - but now seem to have lost their spark.\nThere's the expected pratfalls - Barker tinkling on skateboard legend Tony Hawke, a half-hearted food fight and a family bonding session during a game of kick-the-can in a rainstorm but in an era of Modern Family excellence it's pretty thin gruel.\nThings reach a low when Artie vomits in a child's face.\nFace it Billy, this isn't that funny.",

    "body": "Psycho delivered the shocks, North By Northwest the thrills and Rebecca the Oscar, but if one film can lay claim to the title of The Master's masterpiece, it's Vertigo.\nA seamless combination of psychological mystery, twisted romance, surrealism and technical innovation, it's the perfect embodiment of the Hitchcock motto: to mesmerise, unnerve and discombobulate.\nIn what was to be his last Hitch-up (his age was cited for the film's lukewarm box office), Stewart plays former San Francisco detective John Ferguson, whose nickname 'Scottie' is never explained... unlike his early retirement, the result of a rooftop chase during which Scottie - paralysed by acrophobia - watched helplessly as a fellow officer fell to his death.\nWhile his best friend Midge (Bel Geddes) helps him overcome both his condition and his guilty conscience, Scottie is contacted by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), an old college buddy who wants him to follow his wife Madeleine (Novak).\nGavin is driven not by suspicion but concern. It seems that Madeleine is possessed by the spirit of an ancestor who committed suicide; visiting her grave, returning to her old home, and gazing for hours at her portrait in an art gallery.\nBut the observer is forced to turn saviour when Madeleine throws herself into San Francisco Bay. Beguiled and now completely besotted, he vows to solve the mystery and end her psychological torment forever.\nHis endeavours meet with tragic success.\nMonths later, Scottie is a haunted man. But a chance encounter on the street suggests that history is about to repeat itself...\nHaving written the source novel for the twisty French classic Les Diaboliques, authors Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac allegedly had Hitchcock in mind when they wrote the book D'entre les Morts (Back From The Dead) on which Vertigo is based. Deception and obsession are on the agenda once again.\nOften accused of treating actors like cattle, Hitchcock nevertheless brought out the best from his performers, particularly his leading ladies who were often cast for their (invariably blonde) looks over their acting ability.\nThe glacial Novak was never - and would never be - better than in her dual role here, while Barbara Bel Geddes may forever be remembered as Miss Ellie from Dallas, but her portrayal the loyal, loving Midge is a far worthier legacy.\nAnd while Stewart may have been a tad long in the tooth to convincingly sweep Novak off her feet, this is still one of his most layered performances, encompassing guilt, sadness, and an obsession that verges on the pitiable.\nIt's also impossible not to be seduced by Bernard Herrmann's marvellous score and the superb use of locations in and around San Francisco.\nOn top of all this, the film opened a cinematic box of tricks which are still used today, from Hitch's dizzying zoom in/pull back manoeuvre (capturing Scottie's acrophobia) to artist John Ferren's dream sequence, the influence of which can be seen in TV title sequences as diverse as Doctor Who and Mad Men.\nHitch freely admitted to plot developments that don't quite add up and leaving the odd loose end (think back to the hotel). He called them 'fridge moments', because if he'd done his job right, viewers would be so absorbed they would be safely home before they worked them out.\nBut make no mistake, Vertigo represents The Master at the height of his powers.",
